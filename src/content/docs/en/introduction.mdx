You can use this site to quickly search the catalog of Infrared video transcripts.

Tip - surround multiple words with quotes to search for an exact phrase.

Note: This site is still under construction. Improving transcript quality, missing VODs, more advanced search, filtering, sorting, and other features are planned for the future.

## Vision

Infrared is sitting on a goldmine of content which is mostly inaccessible to newcomers as the most compelling highlights are buried deep among hundreds of unorganized and unedited multihour long VODs spread across multiple channels on multiple platforms.

This site will serve to organize all the VODs in one place where it can be easily browsed, augmented with metadata (eg. categories/tags), searched through, and clipped.
The clips in turn could also be augmented with metadata and made easily browsable/searchable to facilitate content creators who use them to produce edited content for the masses.

With this streamlined process, the community can start building up a library of curated content that is easy to consume and share. Then when the time is right, we can unleash an unstoppable flood of viral content onto the social media platforms (like what happened with Andrew Tate and Sneako) and propel Infrared into the mainstream.

## HELP BRING THE INFRARED FLAME TO THE MASSES

*Better tools/methods for clipping and tagging are planned for the future.

### Video Tagging*
Video tags are currently whatever tags were present on the original YouTube video.
Most of these need to be updated in order to be useful for categorization purposes.
You can use the comments to propose tags under a video page, preferably surrounded with square brackets and separated by commas eg.`[tag1, tag2, tag3]`

### Video Clipping*
Submit clips under the video pages via comments. Please include start and end timestamps in the format `HH:MM:SS` and a description of the clip eg. `01:01:00 - 02:21:00 - Shrimp trials`.

### Missing VODs
If you know of any VODs that are missing from the catalog, you can leave a link in the comments on the [Missing VODs](/en/missing-vods) page.
